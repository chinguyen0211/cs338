2. The port number the client uses for this interaction is 41982.
   The client needs a port to establish and specify a communication channel.
   Without the port, the server might not know where to respond to.

4. Full content of the frame:
   Frame 4: 105 bytes on wire (840 bits), 105 bytes captured (840 bits) on interface eth0, id 0
	    This includes information like interface id (eth0), encapsulation type (Ethernet),
	    frame length (or packet size, 105 bytes/840 bits), capture length (same as frame length, all
	    packets received). This is not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers.

5. [SYN] :  synchronize. This is a packet sent to another computer to request a connection.
	    This is the beginning of the TCP 3-way handshake. If a [SYN, ACK] is sent,
	    it means that the [SYN] is received by the server.

6. [ACK] :  acknowledgement. This is a packet sent to either computer in the connection to acknowledge
	    that the prior message is received.

7. [FIN] :  finish. This is a packet sent by the party that requests the termination of communication/connection.

8. In this exchange, the client initiated the closing of the TCP connection.
   I can tell because in the frame list, the frame 5 contains the first appearance of [FIN] as a part of [FIN, ACK].
   This means that the party with the IP address 172.16.211.128 and port number 41982 requested the termination.
   In this case, the server with those IP address and port number is the client.

==== HTTP ====
1. There were 2 TCP connections opened (two different port numbers of 41296 and 41300).

2. Every time I run wireshark it is a different number of frames, but generally there are 24 frames and your
   homepage (index.html) was requested in frame 7 as follows:
        FRAME #         SOURCE IP               DEST IP                 PROTOCOL        INFO
        7               172.16.211.128          45.79.89.123            HTTP            395 GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
   I can tell that your homepage was requested because of the "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" request.

3. Your photograph (jeff_square_head.jpg) was requested in frame 11 as follows 
        FRAME #         SOURCE IP               DEST IP                 PROTOCOL        INFO
        11               172.16.211.128          45.79.89.123            HTTP            364 GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

1. What is [PSH]?
