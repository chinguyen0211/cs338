2. HOST DETECTION
(-sn is a ping scan; this scan disables port scanning)

== local network ==
- IP addresses for all active hosts on local network:
	+ 172.16.211.1
	+ 172.16.211.2
	+ 172.16.211.128
	+ 172.16.211.129
- these IP addresses represent the live hosts IP addresses connected on this local network.
- steps nmap took:
	+ started TCP connection with the desired IP address
	+ opened a DNS query (followed by mDNS)

== remote network ==
- IP addresses for all active hosts on remote network:
	+ 137.22.4.5
	+ 137.22.4.17
	+ 137.22.4.19
	+ 137.22.4.32
	+ 137.22.4.35
	+ 137.22.4.39
	+ 137.22.4.63
	+ 137.22.4.65
	+ 137.22.4.107
	+ 137.22.4.122
	+ 137.22.4.125
	+ 137.22.4.131
	+ 137.22.4.141
	+ 137.22.4.142
	+ 137.22.4.149
- these IP addresses represent the live / active hosts IP addresses connected on the remote network.
- steps nmap took:
	+ started TCP conection with the desired IP address
	+ opened mDNS query
	
3. PORT SCANNING
- the ports Metasploitable have open are:
	PORT     STATE SERVICE
	21/tcp   open  ftp
	22/tcp   open  ssh
	23/tcp   open  telnet
	25/tcp   open  smtp
	53/tcp   open  domain
	80/tcp   open  http
	111/tcp  open  rpcbind
	139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
	445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
	512/tcp  open  exec
	513/tcp  open  login
	514/tcp  open  shell
	1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
	1524/tcp open  ingreslock
	2049/tcp open  nfs
	2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
	3306/tcp open  mysql
	5432/tcp open  postgresql
	5900/tcp open  vnc
	6000/tcp open  X11
	6667/tcp open  irc
	8009/tcp open  ajp13
	8180/tcp open  unknown
- there are no databalse servers available on Metasploitable (at least those with open ports based on my scan)
- the RSA SSH host key is 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3.
this host key is used to verify that the client is connecting to the correct host / authenticate computers in ssh protocol, hence the moniker host key fingerprint.
- chosen port:
	PORT     STATE SERVICE
	1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
	
	+ this port contains the service rmiregistry, JAVA remote method invocation (RMI) registry. rmiregistry is used to create and start remote object registry on certain assigned ports (bind remote objects to names) or simply, this service allows clients to get a reference (stub) to a remote object.
